# Hey there! 👋 I'm [Your Name]

I'm a front-end developer passionate about building clean, interactive user interfaces with **Vue 3**. Currently working on projects with a solid **component-based architecture** using `components/`, `composables/`, `pages/`, and `layouts/`.

## 🚀 Tech I'm into right now

- 🎨 Front-end Frameworks: **Vue 3**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**
- ⚙️ Tools & Workflow: **VS Code** on **macOS**
- 🧩 Architecture: **Modular components**, **Reusable composables**
- 💡 UX Details: Animations, transitions, and **smooth UI/UX interactions** (like logos that slide when navigating)

## 🌱 Learning & Building

- Leveling up my Vue 3 skills and exploring the ecosystem
- Building **beautiful UIs** with clean code and responsive layouts
- Constantly tweaking and improving user experiences
